# RIS-ISAC-SCNR
This repository provides a MATLAB（CVX） implementation for the joint active and passive beamforming optimization in RIS-assisted ISAC  systems, considering SCNR  constraints. The proposed optimization framework leverages a hybrid FP-SDP-SOCP algorithm to efficiently balance the trade-off between sensing and communication performance.
